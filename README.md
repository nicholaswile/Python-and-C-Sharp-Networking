# Python-and-C-Sharp-Networking

Working on implementing TCP sockets for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) message passing between a Python server and a C# client. 

Eventually planning to host a pre-trained machine learning model on the Python server, and integrate the model into a Unity VR client application.
